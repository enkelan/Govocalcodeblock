## Project Structure

```
src/
  components/      # Reusable React components (Calendar, MeetingForm, MeetingList, SearchBar, ConfirmModal)
  hooks/           # Custom React hooks (useMeetings, useMeetingForm, useDeleteModal)
  utils/           # Utility functions (date, time, validation, meeting filtering, meetingHandlers, storage)
  types.ts         # TypeScript type definitions
  App.tsx          # Main application component
  main.tsx         # Entry point
  index.css        # Global styles
```

## Architecture & Code Quality

- **Separation of Concerns:** UI, logic, and utilities are separated for maintainability.
- **Reusable Utilities & Hooks:** All date, time, validation, and meeting logic is in `src/utils` and `src/hooks` for easy reuse and testing.
- **Instant State Updates:** The UI updates immediately when meetings are created, edited, or deletedâ€”no manual refresh needed.
- **Local Timezone Support:** Dates are handled in the user's local timezone to avoid off-by-one errors.

## Data Flow

- The main state (meetings, selected date, search term) is managed in `App.tsx`.
- Child components receive data and callbacks via props.
- Meetings are persisted in local storage and loaded on app start.
- Components communicate via props and callbacks.
- The main state (meetings, selected date, search term) is managed in `App.tsx`.
